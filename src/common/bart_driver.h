//! This class provides highest-level operations on BART to solve the problems.
/*!
 This class operate BART. The functionalities include:
 
 (1) Build necessary components for BART, such as AQ data, mesh, equations etc. For
     This functionality, please see documentation for BartDriver<dim>::build_basis.
 
 (2) Setting up system.
 
 (3) Reporting system on screen.
 
 (4) Operation calculations at highest level: instantiating Iterations and perform
     iterations.
 
 (5) Output results for visualization.
 
 Note that BartDriver does not touch details about how one specifically solve a
 transport problem. It rather calls Iterations to handle the solving.
